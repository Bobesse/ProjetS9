# pymust

This is a Python reimplementation of the MUST ultrasound toolbox for synthetic image generation and reconstruction (https://www.biomecardio.com/MUST/). 

*Notice:* this is still under development, and might have bugs and errors. Also, even if results should be the same with Matlab version, small numerical differences are expected. If you find any, please open an issue, or send an email to ({damien.garcia@creatis.insa-lyon.fr, gabriel.bernardino@upf.edu}).


## Next steps
- Port of 3D reconstruction and simulation. 
- Port of sptrack and smoothn.
- Parallelize the simus and pfiel computations.
- Update function documentation.
- Add examples.
- Find computational bottlenecks, and optimise (possibly with C extensions).
